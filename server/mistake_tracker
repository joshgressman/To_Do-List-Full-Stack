1. Did not load all the npm files. Prevented the pg from working
- npm init // Loads Node Package Manager
- npm install express --save //Loads json folder and node folders
- npm install body-parser // loads body parser set up req.body objects
-npm install jquery // brings in jquery file / place in vendor file
- npm install bootstrap // optional downloads bootstrap // place in styles or vendors
-npm install pg // installs postgres to use for database communication

2. Routing files not working, several syntax errors and the link was wrong
//app.js
var list = require('./routes/list');
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true}));
app.use('/list', list); //list is the variable above

3. Make sure the click event is not for the whole form, select the button not the
whole form
$('#form').on('click', '#task-submit',  postTask);

4. The bodyParser object exposes various factories to create middlewares.
All middlewares will populate the req.body property with the parsed body,
or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse (or an error was returned).

It populates req.body with (among other things) the value of the POST parameters. Here's the doc and examples: http://expressjs.com/api.html#req.body

bodyParser is a part of "Connect", a set of middlewares for node.js. Here's the real docs and source from Connect:

5. rout links duplicate send a header error from the 500 make sure to crete specific links
when routing multiple POST or GET

6. Transversing the DOM to find elements needed worked

7. Next time may be easier to append to a from/input instead of a table, in
return may be easier to pull data from DOM using serialize array

8. when routing to modules make sure protocal is followed when linking and exporting

9. note the id used in client.query, make sure to make use of $1 $numbers to
   select values
